# X_ray_datasheet

This tube is without metal cap on the top, instead there is a wire. Look at photo please!


This is interesting tube that have allowable construction to emit X-Rays even without heating.
On the video I have shown how it make my dosimeter crazy and how beautiful its glow during process.

Somehow I was not know, but its a popular tube for cheap X-Ray DIY, here is review found on internet:

X-rays
http://boginjr.com/electronics/xrays/... The 6BC-1 tube is a more powerful x-ray emitter than the commonly used DY-86 rectifier. Just listen to the Geiger counter's ticks and compare it with the DY86 one. Also "flying random dots" can be seen on the video, these are beta/gamma particles emitted from the valve.

Here is another project based on this tube: https://danyk.cz/rtg2_en.html

Electron-beam rectifier-stabilizer of high voltage (4 kV). The type designation is unusual - two-letter, obviously from the late 40s - early 50s.

Producer - Moscow Electric Lamp Plant.

Description from Computer Repair Forum: "Inside is a typical kinescope electron gun, attached label calls it "Electronic Device" and the electrodes are named accordingly - cathode, modulator, accelerating electrode... Anode voltage recommended 4kV, accelerating electrode 200V, modulator blocking voltage about -30V ... the allowable voltage is from 4 to 7.7kV. At the same time, no currents, except for 0.6A of incandescence, are given at all. And the structure inside is typically kinescope, completely unlike an ordinary lamp."
    Well, in general, it should be noted that the lamp is assembled directly from elements of the searchlight borrowed from the CRT, probably 18LK15.
  

Tube come in a box with datasheet.
